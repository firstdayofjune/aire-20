\subsection{Word Embeddings}
In order for our approach to also respect the semantic regularities of the requirements sentences, it is not enough to rely on the clusters generated by the LDA, as mentioned in \autoref{sub:back_word_embeddings}. We therefore create word embeddings, using the techniques we described earlier.
