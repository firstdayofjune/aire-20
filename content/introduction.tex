	The result of a good software is depends on a lot more than the pure engineering.
	Software is designed to perform and automate a task, which otherwise would have to be executed manually.
	In order to fulfill the given task properly, it is necessary to completely understand the task's underlying problem. One strategic approach to develop this understanding is to conduct a thorough analysis of the requirements (of both the business and the software) and to document the results according to given standards. This process is called requirements engineering (RE). The work products of the RE process can be manifold. In the scope of this research study we will therefore focus on the actual requirements.\\

	One part of the RE process is to collect, order and prioritize the requirements. Depending on the number of requirements, it may help or even be necessary to use some data analysis techniques to automatically derive some useful insights, which can then be used in the further decision-making process.

In this paper, we aim to automatically analyze the Smart Home requirements collected Murukannaiah et al. for the \crowdre{} project\cite{murukannaiah_toward_2017} in 2016. We will put ourselves in the perspective of a fictitious product owner, who wants to answer the following question:\\
\begin{quote}
\textit{Given a set of requirement sentences, what kind of features are my potential customers interested in the most?}
\end{quote}

We consider our product owner to be working in a company which builds smart home appliances and deem the \crowdre{} requirements to be the result of a survey that company has performed. The collected requirements therefore are the foundation of our analysis.\\
Considering the number of requirements (2966), we want to automate our analysis using the Python programming language and a word2vec model to derive a set of categories where the collected requirements can be assigned to. Finally, we want to answer our initial question based on the categories we found and the number of requirements assigned to each of the categories.
