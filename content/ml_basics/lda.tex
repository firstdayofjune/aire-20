\subsection{Latent Dirichlet Allocation} % (fold)
\label{sub:lda}
The LDA is a probabilistic model that can be used for discrete data. It is a statistical approach that can be used to generate a topic model for text corpora \cite{blei_latent_nodate}. The technique starts with selection a number of expected topics. The LDA then use all terms that are inside of the collection of documents and generates a polynomial distribution over all terms inside of the documents. Afterwards for each document a dirichlet distribution is performed which assumes that each document only contains a limited amount of topics. Target of the approach is to get the latent topcis that are are core of the document collection.
