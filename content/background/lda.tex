\subsection{Latent Dirichlet allocation} % (fold)
\label{sub:lda}


The Latent Dirichlet allocation is a technique that can be used to observe groups of similar data within a dataset. The LDA is a probabilistic model that works for discrete data where hidden topics are assumed. The LDA was supposed by Blei et. al in \cite{blei_latent_nodate}.
Within the LDA there are several terms that describe the data. The word is the basic unit of the discrete data. The collection of words is named a document and the set of documents is called corpus.
The approach aims to find a limited number of topics that were latent inside of the documents of the corpus. To do so, the documents get \textit{''represented as probability distributions over latent topics where each topic is characterized  by a distribution over words''} \cite{niu_topic2vec_2015}:
The LDA uses all words that are inside of the collection of documents and generates a polynomial distribution over all terms inside of the documents. Afterwards, for each document a Dirichlet distribution is performed which assumes that each document only contains a limited number of topics which is the basic assumption of this approach.
