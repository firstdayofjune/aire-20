\section{Findings} % (fold)
\label{sec:findings}

For our approaches that have the task to generate topics for the given dataset we expect four different topics that match to the labeled domains: Energy, Entertainment, Health and Safety. The other data that was assigned to the topic Other is assumed as noise to the result.


\subsection{LDA} % (fold)
\label{sub:findings_lda}

Unfortunately the result of the LDA doesn't match the expected topics. The approach itself create 5 clusters that can't be mapped to the expected ones from the domain. But there is still some similarity between the requirements that are next to each other.

The calculaton of the LDA approach is very fast which means the performance of the algorithm fits good for that kind of task. But unfortunately the overall result is that we weren't able to gather topics from the given dataset.

\subsection{word2vec} % (fold)
\label{sub:findings_w2v}

\begin{itemize}
\item two clusters -> not matching expected 4 clusters (different domain)
\item fast/performing
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Word Mover's Distance} % (fold)
\label{sub:findings_wmd}

\begin{itemize}
\item best result
\item only 3 clusters instead of expected (4)
\item very long processing time
\item improvement possible because of symmetric matrix
\end{itemize}
