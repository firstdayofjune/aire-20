\colorbox{yellow!30}{ToDo:} Compare the results of the both methods


\colorbox{yellow!30}{ToDo:} Finally, our initial questions can be answered as follows:

\colorbox{yellow!30}{ToDo:} Discuss the results (maybe a new chapter for that?


As expected, our dataset was too small to achieve any better results. In this context, it is important to know how the accuracy of the word2vec phrase detection dropped to 66\% when Mikolov et al. trained their model on a "smaller" dataset of 6 billion words\cite[p7]{mikolov_distributed_2013}. \emph{Smaller} at least in comparison to their final training set, but this is still a lot larger than our dataset by a factor of almost 120.000.
