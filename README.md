Content should be grouped into separate files and added to the *content* directory appropriately. The individual files can then be included in the main.tex using the `\input{contet/...}` directive.

Any acronyms introduced to the document, may be added to the *misc/acronyms.tex* in alphabetical order.

Bibliographic references go to the *references.bib* and can further be referenced using the `\cite{...}` or the `\cite[p123]{...}` command.
