	abstract = {Crowd {RE} is an emerging avenue for engaging the general public or the so called crowd in variety of requirements engineering tasks. Crowd {RE} scales {RE} by involving, potentially, millions of users. Although humans are at the center of Crowd {RE}, automated techniques are necessary (1) to derive useful insights from large amounts of raw data the crowd can produce; and (2) to drive the Crowd {RE} process, itself, by facilitating novel workﬂows combining crowd and machine intelligence.},

	title = {Latent {Dirichlet} {Allocation}},
	abstract = {We describe latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), a generative probabilistic model for collections of discrete data such as text corpora. LDA is a three-level hierarchical Bayesian model, in which each item of a collection is modeled as a ﬁnite mixture over an underlying set of topics. Each topic is, in turn, modeled as an inﬁnite mixture over an underlying set of topic probabilities. In the context of text modeling, the topic probabilities provide an explicit representation of a document. We present efﬁcient approximate inference techniques based on variational methods and an EM algorithm for empirical Bayes parameter estimation. We report results in document modeling, text classiﬁcation, and collaborative ﬁltering, comparing to a mixture of unigrams model and the probabilistic LSI model.},
