	title = {Latent {Dirichlet} {Allocation}},
	abstract = {We describe latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), a generative probabilistic model for collections of discrete data such as text corpora. LDA is a three-level hierarchical Bayesian model, in which each item of a collection is modeled as a ﬁnite mixture over an underlying set of topics. Each topic is, in turn, modeled as an inﬁnite mixture over an underlying set of topic probabilities. In the context of text modeling, the topic probabilities provide an explicit representation of a document. We present efﬁcient approximate inference techniques based on variational methods and an EM algorithm for empirical Bayes parameter estimation. We report results in document modeling, text classiﬁcation, and collaborative ﬁltering, comparing to a mixture of unigrams model and the probabilistic LSI model.},

	abstract = {Automated manipulation of natural language requirements, for classification, tracing, defect detection, information extraction, and other tasks, has been pursued by requirements engineering ({RE}) researchers for more than two decades. Recent technological advancements in natural language processing ({NLP}) have made it possible to apply this research more widely within industrial settings. This technical briefing targets researchers and practitioners, and aims to give an overview of what {NLP} can do today for {RE} problems, and what could do if specific research challenges, also emerging from practical experiences, are addressed. The talk will: survey current research on applications of {NLP} to {RE} problems; present representative industrially-ready techniques, with a focus on defect detection and information extraction problems; present enabling technologies in {NLP} that can play a role in {RE} research, including distributional semantics representations; discuss criteria for evaluation of {NLP} techniques in the {RE} context; outline the main challenges for a systematic application of the techniques in industry. The crosscutting topics that will permeate the talk are the need for domain adaptation, and the essential role of the human-in-the-loop.},

Crowd {RE} scales {RE} by involving, potentially, millions of users. Although humans are at the center of Crowd {RE}, automated techniques are necessary (1) to derive useful insights from large amounts of raw data the crowd can produce; and (2) to drive the Crowd {RE} process, itself, by facilitating novel workﬂows combining crowd and machine intelligence.},

	abstract = {As the majority of online networking on the Internet, opinion mining has turned into a fundamental way to deal with investigating such huge numbers of information. Different applications show up in an extensive variety of modern areas. In the interim, opinions have various pronunciations which bring along investigate challenges. The research challenges make opinion mining a dynamic research region recently. In this paper, Natural Language Processing ({NLP}) techniques for opinion mining and sentiment analysis are reviewed. Initially {NLP} is reviewed then briefed about its common and useful preprocessing steps also. In this paper opinion mining for various levels are analyzed and reviewed. At the end issues are identified and some recommendation are suggested for opinion mining and-sentiment-analysis.},
