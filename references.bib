	abstract = {Crowd {RE} is an emerging avenue for engaging the general public or the so called crowd in variety of requirements engineering tasks. Crowd {RE} scales {RE} by involving, potentially, millions of users. Although humans are at the center of Crowd {RE}, automated techniques are necessary (1) to derive useful insights from large amounts of raw data the crowd can produce; and (2) to drive the Crowd {RE} process, itself, by facilitating novel workï¬‚ows combining crowd and machine intelligence.},
