	abstract = {We describe latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), a generative probabilistic model for collections of discrete data such as text corpora. LDA is a three-level hierarchical Bayesian model, in which each item of a collection is modeled as a ﬁnite mixture over an underlying set of topics. Each topic is, in turn, modeled as an inﬁnite mixture over an underlying set of topic probabilities. In the context of text modeling, the topic probabilities provide an explicit representation of a document. We present efﬁcient approximate inference techniques based on variational methods and an EM algorithm for empirical Bayes parameter estimation. We report results in document modeling, text classiﬁcation, and collaborative ﬁltering, comparing to a mixture of unigrams model and the probabilistic LSI model.},

This technical briefing targets researchers and practitioners, and aims to give an overview of what {NLP} can do today for {RE} problems, and what could do if specific research challenges, also emerging from practical experiences, are addressed. The talk will: survey current research on applications of {NLP} to {RE} problems; present representative industrially-ready techniques, with a focus on defect detection and information extraction problems; present enabling technologies in {NLP} that can play a role in {RE} research, including distributional semantics representations; discuss criteria for evaluation of {NLP} techniques in the {RE} context; outline the main challenges for a systematic application of the techniques in industry. The crosscutting topics that will permeate the talk are the need for domain adaptation, and the essential role of the human-in-the-loop.},

	abstract = {We present the Word Mover's Distance ({WMD}), a novel distance function between text documents. Our work is based on recent results in word embeddings that learn semantically meaningful representations for words from local cooccurrences in sentences. The {WMD} distance measures the dissimilarity between two text documents as the minimum amount of distance that the embedded words of one document need to "travel" to reach the embedded words of another document. We show that this distance metric can be cast as an instance of the Earth Mover's Distance, a well studied transportation problem for which several highly efficient solvers have been developed. Our metric has no hyperparameters and is straight-forward to implement. Further, we demonstrate on eight real world document classification data sets, in comparison with seven state-of-the-art baselines, that the {WMD} metric leads to unprecedented low k-nearest neighbor document classification error rates.},

	abstract = {The recently introduced continuous Skip-gram model is an efficient method for learning high-quality distributed vector representations that capture a large number of precise syntactic and semantic word relationships. In this paper we present several extensions that improve both the quality of the vectors and the training speed. By subsampling of the frequent words we obtain significant speedup and also learn more regular word representations. We also describe a simple alternative to the hierarchical softmax called negative sampling. An inherent limitation of word representations is their indifference to word order and their inability to represent idiomatic phrases. For example, the meanings of "Canada" and "Air" cannot be easily combined to obtain "Air Canada". Motivated by this example, we present a simple method for finding phrases in text, and show that learning good vector representations for millions of phrases is possible.},

Furthermore, we show that these vectors provide state-of-the-art performance on our test set for measuring syntactic and semantic word similarities.},

In this framework, we implement several popular algorithms for topical inference, including Latent Semantic Analysis and Latent Dirichlet Allocation, in a way that makes them completely independent of the training corpus size. Particular emphasis is placed on straightforward and intuitive framework design, so that modifications and extensions of the methods and/or their application by interested practitioners are effortless. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach on a real-world scenario of computing document similarities within an existing digital library {DML}-{CZ}.},

Glossary term extraction methods often focus on achieving a high recall rate and, therefore, favor linguistic proecssing for extracting glossary term candidates and neglect the beneﬁts from reducing the number of candidates by statistical ﬁlter methods. However, especially for large datasets a reduction of the likewise large number of candidates may be crucial. This paper demonstrates how to automatically extract relevant domain-speciﬁc glossary term candidates from a large body of requirements, the CrowdRE dataset. Our hybrid approach combines linguistic processing and statistical ﬁltering for extracting and reducing glossary term candidates. In a twofold evaluation, we examine the impact of our approach on the quality and quantity of extracted terms. We provide a ground truth for a subset of the requirements and show that a substantial degree of recall can be achieved. Furthermore, we advocate requirements coverage as an additional quality metric to assess the term reduction that results from our statistical ﬁlters. Results indicate that with a careful combination of linguistic and statistical extraction methods, a fair balance between later manual efforts and a high recall rate can be achieved.},
